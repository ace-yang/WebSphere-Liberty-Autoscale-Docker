# Liberty Autoscale Cluster for Docker script

Author: [Roman Kharkovski](http://kharkovski.blogspot.com/).

This repository is a Bash script for Linux to build and run WebSphere Application Server Liberty cluster with Docker autoscale capability. Instead of following a complex setup process and navigating many pages of product documentation, this script allows for "one click" creation of the entire environment and can be easily customized to suit individual needs of a user.

Getting started instructions can be found here: [IBMadvantage.com blog post](https://ibmadvantage.com/2016/08/29/websphere-liberty-autoscale-clustering-with-docker/).

Video of this script in action can be found on [my YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/JVyW5iYIJsA).
